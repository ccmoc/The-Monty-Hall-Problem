# The-Monty-Hall-Problem
A C# simulation of the Monty Hall Problem

When ran this program will ask for 2 numbers. One is the amount of times you want to simulate the Monty Hall problem with the choice 'stay' which means to keep your first chosen door. The other is the amount of times you want to simulate switches.

>The Monty Hall problem is a counter-intuitive statistics puzzle:

>There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car.You pick a door (call it door A). You’re hoping for the car of course.Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (B & C)
 and always opens one of them with a goat (Both doors might have goats; 
he’ll randomly pick one to open)
Here’s the game: Do you stick with door A (original guess) or switch to the other unopened door? Does it matter?

>Surprisingly, the odds aren’t 50-50. If you switch doors you’ll win 2/3 of the time!

By using this program you will be able to simulate the problem itself, a large specific amount of simulations if you wish to do so.

Overall it is quite a useless program but I learned a lot more about C# through this so I don't regret doing this at all.
